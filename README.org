* Synopsis

*Projectile Drupal* is a minor mode for working with the Drupal 7 projects in GNU Emacs.
Internally it based on [[Projectile][https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile]].

It means that you can use Projectile's commands for greping (or acking) files,
run tests, switch between projects, etc.  It's a great way to navigate a
Drupal multi-site or dslm bases site file structure.

With Projectile Drupal you are able to:

- navigate through drupal resources (modules, themes, profiles and so on)
- have project environment variables available emacs shells such as eshell
- run drush --uli

* Setup

** Installation

Eventually this might be a MELPA package.

But for now, you can do this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/projectile-drupal")
(require 'projectile-drupal)
#+END_SRC


* Usage

** Hooking up with Projectile

To make it start alongside `projectile-mode`:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'projectile-mode-hook 'projectile-drupal-on)
#+END_SRC

That will start it only if the current project is a Drupal project.

Probably you should read Projectile's [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][README]] on setting up the completion
system, caching and indexing files. Although the default settings are quite
sensible and you should be ready to go without much tweaking.

You might want to create your own keybinding for your favorite commands. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key projectile-drupal-mode-map (kbd "s-c")   'projectile-drupal-find-custom-directory)
(define-key projectile-drupal-mode-map (kbd "s-S")   'projectile-drupal-find-settings-file-name)
#+END_SRC


* Beyond

Consider installing other Emacs packages that can help you working
specifically with Drupal projects such as [[https://github.com/arnested/drupal-mode][drupal-mode]] for editing drupal
files.

** Templates

| Extension | Alternatives       |
|-----------+--------------------|
| erb       | [[https://github.com/fxbois/web-mode][web-mode]], [[https://github.com/purcell/mmm-mode][mmm-mode]] |
| yaml      | [[https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode][yaml-mode]]          |

** Running drush

Some of the Projectile Drupal functions run the drush executable.

OS X users might want to look at [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]].

* Contribution

Pull requests and issues are welcome as I would like this project to grow to
support Drupal 8 with emacs.
