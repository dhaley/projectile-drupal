Feature: Opening logs file
  In order to read log files
  As a user
  I want to be able to watch log files

Scenario: Opening development log
  Given I open the app file "app/models/user.rb"
  And file "log/development.log" exists
  And I turn on projectile-mode
  When I run command "projectile-drupal-find-log" selecting "development.log"
  Then I am in file "log/development.log"
  And the buffer is auto reverting
  And projectile-drupal should be turned on
